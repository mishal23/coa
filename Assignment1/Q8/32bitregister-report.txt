Register

- To form a register, gate level modelling of a D-FlipFlop is used from the previous question.
- The inputs are first sent to the D Latch, the outputs of which are fed to the gated SR Latch forming a D-FlipFlop circuit.
- Using generate block 32 bits are called again and again to get the required 32 bit register.
